# FALLING SQUARES GAME
**Author: Cezary Petryka**

**It's a simple game created in JavaFX.**

## Description of the game

At the beginning, a menu is displayed in which the user can select the duration of the game and the difficulty level.

Then, the application displays a window containing a panel and a label. New squares appear at random points at the top of the panel and fall downwards. The player's task is to 'kill' them with a click of the mouse before they reach the bottom of the screen. Squares clicked and those that have reached the bottom of the panel disappear. The label at the bottom displays the current score.

After chosen time, the game ends: the movement of squares stops, no new squares are created and a message is displayed. We consider the game won if the fraction displayed on the label is higher than a certain predefined value.
